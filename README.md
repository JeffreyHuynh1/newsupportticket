## Support Ticketing App

This application was built to address issues of various consumers. The idea is that if a company were to sell a product, customers can post any problems that they are having. This way, employees from the company can view all of the issues addressed by the customers and try to resolve them accordingly. In order to use the application, customers access the website and are prompted to login. This way, only authenticated users (customers) can submit a ticket with a title, description of the problem, and the department(HR, Operations Management, Finance, Marketing, IT) that ticket is related to. Afterwards, there ticket will be displayed on the dashboard and they are able to track the status of their ticket.
